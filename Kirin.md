**Physiology**

Kirin resembles a unicorn, though a closer look reveals that it is covered in scales rather than a coat. 
Its majestic white mane and hair stand on end, as if charged with static. The monster often crackles with stray electricity.


**Abilities**

Kirin can summon lightning to strike attackers or the area around it.
When Kirin is threatened or provoked, it can wreath itself in lightning, which is proven to harden it's hide. 
Kirin has very few physical attacks and relies mostly on lightning strikes as it's main force of attacking foes.


**Behavior**

Kirin appear to be relatively peaceful and passive creatures, yet they are quite capable of launching a powerful barrage 
of lightning attacks on their foes. Using their extreme agility, Kirin can literally run circles around their opponent, 
getting in close to gore an enemy with their horn, only to quickly dart away and prepare anotherassault.
Kirin are very mobile and can jump and run incredible distances in short amounts of time.
